components/: Segregated into layout, product, category, and ui for high reusability.

context/: Centralized state management for Cart and Products.

hooks/: Custom hooks for clean data fetching logic.

services/: Axios base configuration and API endpoint abstraction.

📝 Implementation Notes
UI Fidelity: Every pixel, spacing, and typography choice was made to match the Figma blueprint as closely as possible.

Clean Code: Followed DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles, especially in the UI components like Buttons and Cards.

Commits: Maintained a meaningful commit history (e.g., feat:, fix:, refactor:) to show the development progress.

State Logic: Used Context API for the Cart to ensure state persistence across different pages without page reloads.
